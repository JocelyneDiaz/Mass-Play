# Mass-Play

#### This project seeks to bring community engagement design closer to architectural design, by developing a software platform that engages the community. Architecture is typically taught and understood as a top-down methodology, in which the architect ultimately proposes a design for the site. This project proposes a concrete way in which members of the community can contribute to the design of architecture by building software that is accessible and friendly. The project uses simple masses to provide users that are unfamiliar with architecture a set recognizable geometry to design with. The project allows the user to experience the role of an architect. While having a say in the design process and exposing them to something new. Mass play is a software platform that encourages the playful engagement of the community in the development of architectural form. This software will also display, when given the same software and rules, what a group of people with different knowledge can create.
